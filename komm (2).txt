Jeg har brukt den oppdaterte vesjonen av koden.

Do not put the tree components into the same directory "tasklist". Rather create one directory for each component and put everything belonging to the component in its own directory.

If no connection with the database, the button "New task" should remain disabled. In your application, the button is enabled even also if the back end does not respond to the ajax calls.

No need of defer with script tag if type="module".

The status shown on the SELECT element is not reset to <Modify>.
When selecting status <Modify> after e.g. changing to WAITING, the status is set to the value "0".

After removing all tasks, and then adding a new task, the new task is added above the table header.

Synchronization
You have problems with synchronization in your solution.
When removing a task, you remove the tasks from the display BEFORE the server has confirmed that the task was being deleted.

When updating the status of a task, the status is updated in the display BEFORE the server has confirmed that the task was being updated.

TaskBox
Use mode "closed" with attachShadow. If open, the inside of the component is accessible from other components through the shadowRoot property.

TaskList
Method getNumtasks, have your more than one tbody? Would this do the same, with table a reference to the HTML table?
table.tBodies[0].rows.length

Something is weird with your solution. You are calling the public methods changestatusCallback and deletetaskCallback of TaskList from within TaskList. These methdos are to be used by TaskView, not TaskList.
